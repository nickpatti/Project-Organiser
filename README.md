# Project-Organiser
Unfinished -  I have started to redo this in C#

An application to show progress on various projects, and to move projects in the windows directory to the "Completed Projects" folder when they are marked as completed.

Programming in Python using Tkinter as a form of practice using GUIs, will be redone in C# to practice.
